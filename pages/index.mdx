# Introduction

The goal of this website is to provide comprehensive documentation and examples of how OneToGo is developed and how it works.

The documentation is still a work in progress and will be finalized soon. (Before the start of national phase of [InfoEducatie 2023](https://infoeducatie.ro))

# Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root folder.
Then, inside the root folder create a `.env.local` file and add the following variables:

```env
# Firebase
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

# Stripe
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

To run the application, run `npm run dev` in the root folder.

# Develpment

While developing OneToGo, I followed the SOLID programming principles and the Clean Architecture. The goal was to create a scalable and maintainable application that is easy to extend and test.

The application is split into three layers:

#### Presentation Layer

Formed by the `/app`, and `/components` folders. This layer contains the UI components and the logic for rendering them.

#### Logic Layer

Formed by the custom hooks in the `/hooks` folder. This layer contains the logic for handling the data and the business logic.

#### Data Layer

Formed by the `/services` folder. This layer contains the logic for fetching and sending data to the backend.
