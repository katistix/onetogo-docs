# Testing OneToGo

OneToGo uses both [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for testing. Jest is used for unit testing and Cypress is used for end-to-end testing.

## Unit testing with Jest

To run the unit tests, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run all the unit tests in the project.

As a standard practice, all unit tests are written in the same directory as the component they are testing. For example, the unit tests for the `App` component are written in `src/components/App/App.test.ts`.

## End to end testing with Cypress

Running end to end tests requires the application to be running in _test mode_ and also requires the Firebase Emulators to be running.

1. First, run the emulators:

    ```bash
    npm run emulators
    ```

2. Then, run the application in test mode:
    ```bash
    npm run cypress
    ```

A browser window will open with the Cypress test runner. Click on the test you want to run and it will run in the browser window.

As a standard practice, all end to end tests are written in the `cypress/` directory.
For example the end to end tests for the `App` component are written in `cypress/e2e/App.cy.ts`.
